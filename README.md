## Level Format (`.sw`)
The level format in SpaceWarp++ consists of several components:

### Emoji Representation
The first 16 lines of the level file represent an emoji-based visualization of the level. Each emoji corresponds to a specific tile in the game. Here's an example:
```
⬜⬜1️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣1️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣2️⃣1️⃣

```

### Level Exits
The following 4 lines in the level file indicate which level to go to based on the direction the player exits. A value of -1 indicates that the corresponding direction is not an available exit. For example:
```
2
-1
-1
-1
```
In this case, exiting in the upward direction leads to level 2, while the other directions don't provide an exit.

### Player Reset Location
The subsequent 2 lines in the level file represent the X and Y coordinates of the player's reset position within the map. These coordinates determine where the player respawns after resetting:
```
13
3
```
In this example, the player's reset position is at coordinates (13, 3) on the map.
